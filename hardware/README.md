I use a *Slimbots Bear board - IR Transmitter and Receiver for the Raspberry Pi* from [https://www.tindie.com/products/Slimbots/raspberry-pi-ir-txrx-home-automation](https://www.tindie.com/products/Slimbots/raspberry-pi-ir-txrx-home-automation). This board is put on top of a Raspberry Pi and connects to pins 1 - 26 of the connector P1. Unluckily, the board is hardwired to use GPIO 17 to send IR signals while the only hardware pwm enabled GPIO of the raspberry Pi (of the 26 connected pins) is GPIO 18. Again unluckily, the board uses GPIO 18 to _receive_ IR signals. consequently, to use hardware pwm with this board, the hardware needs to be modified.

Disrupt (e.g., with a razor blade) the existing connections between GPIO 18 and the IR receiver, and between GPIO 17 and the Darlington chip (see yellow arrows on slimbots.jpg). Then connect GPIO 18 with the Darlington chip (red wire on slimbots.jpg). To use the IR receiver, also connect GPIO 17 with the IR receiver (green wire on slimbots.jpg).
